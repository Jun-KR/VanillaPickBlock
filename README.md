## :book: Introduction  
if you pick Block in PMMP, the item in your hands is changed to the block item.  
This is different from working in vanilla.  
<br>  
In vanilla it works like :  
- When already item in hotbar, just switching hand to that hotbar.
- When already item in inventory, just swaping hand with inventory slot  
- When new item, Set first remaining hot bar to block-item and switching hand to that hotbar.  
- When hotbar is fulled, Set item in hand to block-item, And if item in hand, move to inventory.

This plugin actually changes it to work that way.
